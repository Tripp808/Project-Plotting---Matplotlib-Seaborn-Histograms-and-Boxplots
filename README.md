# Fuel Economy Analysis Project

## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing fuel economy data to gain insights into the relationships between various features and their impact on greenhouse gas emissions (ghgScore). The dataset provides information on different vehicles, including their make, model, year, fuel type, fuel efficiency, carbon dioxide emissions, and more.

## Project Goals:
- Analyze the correlations between different features in the dataset.
- Visualize the data using histograms and a correlation heatmap.
- Interpret the visualizations to understand the story they tell.
- Identify features that are most relevant for predicting greenhouse gas scores (ghgScore).

## Files:
- **fuel_econ.csv**: The dataset containing fuel economy data.
- **Project_Plots.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- **heatmap_visualization.png**: Output file of the correlation heatmap.
- **co2_emissions_histogram.png**: Output file of the histogram depicting carbon dioxide emissions.
- **city_fuel_efficiency_histogram.png**: Output file of the histogram depicting city fuel efficiency.
- **highway_fuel_efficiency_histogram.png**: Output file of the histogram depicting highway fuel efficiency.

## Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Use:
1. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Open and run the `Project_Plots.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to analyze the data, create visualizations, and interpret the results.
